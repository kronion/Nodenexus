    <p>While classes and constant reading are obviously crucial to the learning process, there's no substitute to getting your hands dirty. 
    Furthermore, college simply cannot teach you everything you need to know in practice.
    To supplement my studies at Princeton, I spend a great deal of my time working on personal projects. 
    The following is an (incomplete) list of things I've made or continue to hack on.
    <h2>Lucidity</h2>

      Lucidity began as an excuse to make a WebSockets application for an introductory web development class, which I was teaching at the time. 
      I wanted to write an application which the students could use throughout the class before ultimately making it themselves. 
      The original backend was a mere twelve lines of code, but it quickly grew to implement many popular features of chat clients such as IRC and Twitch chat. 
      Lucidity can be embedded in other applications and allows for customization by both clients and administrators. 
      Check it out below!
