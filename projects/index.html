<h1>PROJECTS</h1>
<p>While classes and constant reading are obviously crucial to the learning process, there's no substitute to getting your hands dirty. Furthermore, college simply cannot teach you everything you need to know in practice. To supplement my studies at Princeton, I spend a great deal of my time working on personal projects. The following is an (incomplete) list of things I've made or continue to hack on.</p>
<h2>Lucidity</h2>

  Lucidity began as an excuse to make a WebSockets application for an introductory web development class, which I was teaching at the time. 
  I wanted to write an application which the students could use throughout the class before ultimately making it themselves. 
  The original backend was a mere twelve lines of code, but it quickly grew to implement many popular features of chat clients such as IRC and Twitch chat. 
  Lucidity can be embedded in other applications and allows for customization by both clients and administrators. 
  Check it out below!

<h2>GoGoTo</h2>
<p class='meta'>March 17 2015 &middot; <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gogoto/aafbnclakfldlfneckdnnaojkeepdpcg'>View in Chrome Web Store</a></p>
<p>If you're like me (a die-hard Vimmer), then you abhor the idea of needing to touch your mouse. Google used to be good to us, allowing users to tab through search results and open them with the enter key. Then, without warning, Google yanked the feature. I decided to put it back.</p>
<p>GoGoTo is a tiny Chrome extension (8.01KB uncompressed) that replicates the old Google tab-through-results experience exactly as I remember it. With the Google search results page in focus, press tab to move between entries. Press enter to "click" the targeted result. Tabbing past all ten results brings the focus back to the search bar.</p>
<p>You can download GoGoTo right here:<button class="webstore" type="button" data-storeid="aafbnclakfldlfneckdnnaojkeepdpcg" style="margin-left: 20px"></button></p>
