  <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
  <div class='post'>
    <p>
      I am a senior studying computer science at Princeton University. I am writing this blog as part of a larger effort to organize my thoughts and be self-critical. I chose to blog instead of keeping a private journal because it seemed more fun to bring other people along for the ride. I only hope that you gain as much from my perspective as I do from your feedback.
    </p>

      Studying computer science was a gut decision for me. I started my career at Princeton as an aerospace engineer and changed majors after having my mind blown by an introductory course in Java. I never looked back. Some of my favorite classes have covered topics including computer networks, HCI, computational and algorithmic reasoning, and system design.

      This past summer, I interned for Microsoft's Bing team as a full-stack web developer. I previously interned at TripAdvisor as a member of their product personalization team.

      My current focus is on technologies which do a better job of collecting or presenting data in context. These technologies include "smart things" and wearables, note-taking and personal efficiency applications, and content recommendation systems. I want computers to see me as more than a bag of words or properties. Success will yield a digital world which is more intuitive and accessible from our own.

      I'm also interested in information security, digital rights, and the structure of the Internet Society. In particular, I wish to study how the interaction of technology and policy affects the expression of individuals and groups on the Internet. I want to design "socially conscientious technologies" which improve the nature of communication among digital neighbors.

      When I'm not studying computer science, I'm a bit of a humanities nerd. I've taken classes on 20th century art history, ancient literature, and poetry. I've also taken a healthy number of classes on topics in entrepreneurship. The unifying themes are social analysis and the importance of the creative process.

      I'm currently the director of the Princeton Entrepreneurship Club's Hack Classes program. Our mission is to teach aspiring entrepreneurs essential skills in the realms of technology, design, and business. I'm also just embarking on a new project called Not By Default, a high-touch mentorship program targeting students who feel they are stuck on a "default" career path. NBD will teach students how to find and create opportunities, perform due diligence analyses, and, most importantly, justify the career decisions they ultimately make.

      I take on a lot of projects, but I make time for R&R. In my free time I like to juggle, write poetry, play poker, and make things. I attend as many hacakthons as I can (and several more than I should), and I hang out frequently in the Hackathon Hackers community. I do much of my web development with Node.js, the one true dev language. ;)
